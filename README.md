# Matcheum Dating App 2021 @cmda-bt-20-21

## About

Imagine you want to go to a museum you have never been to before, for example Het Stedelijk museum, but you know nothing about the art, style, building, etc. So instead of wondering inside a building that is filled with paintings of one color only, aka abstract art, you just don't go. What a pity! The story behind the painting is the real art! You need someone to tell you about those stories. Here comes the application in play! With this application you will have the opportunity to find a museum buddy, who will guide and tell you all about the museum you want to visit. Make your museum visit even more special with a museum buddy!

Machteum is an application where people who go to museums can get in touch with each other.
